## Description

The WProofreader plugin automatically checks spelling and grammar in multiple languages on websites, built with WordPress 4.x, and the new WordPress 5.x.

**The plugin works in two comfortable modes:**

* instant, underlining mistakes while you type, and 
* dialog, proofreading all the text at once in a separate pop-up window.

Here are a few highlights of how the plugin can be useful for your websites:

### Multilingual
The Pro version proofreads in 15 languages, plus spell checking in Finnish and Norwegian Bokmal. You can also extend the spell checking with any of [150+ additional languages](https://webspellchecker.com/additional-dictionaries/) and the specialized dictionaries such as [medical](https://webspellchecker.com/additional-dictionaries/#medical-dictionary) or [legal](https://webspellchecker.com/additional-dictionaries/#legal-dictionary).

6 languages are spell checked in the Free version.

### Grammar-Savvy

The Pro version is able of checking of not only spelling, but grammar in 15 languages as well.

### Customizable

The Pro version provides an option of adding specialized terminology, acronyms, proper names, etc. into Personal User Dictionaries, stored in the cloud and available for review and management from any browser, or to Global Custom Dictionaries, managed at the subscription admin level and available across all the websites under given license key.

In the Free version the users can create their Personal User Dictionaries as well. However, they will not be saved to cloud, so the dictionary can only be used from a single browser and device.  The Global Custom Dictionaries are not available in the Free version.

### Powerful

The Pro version proofreads up to 100 million words per year, and can be used in up to 5 websites.  

The free version checks spelling in to 50 thousand words per day on one website. Once the limit is reached the proofreading stops until the next day.

### Modern

The plugin seamlessly integrates with websites, built in WordPress 4.x, and the new WordPress 5.x with the Gutenberg editor.

The following browsers are supported: 

* Chrome
* Firefox 
* Safari
* MS Edge
* Internet Explorer 11

With all the content to post, the Proofreader plugin is a real time-saver, carefully checking texts right in your text editor. 

It might be particularly handy:

* for heavy-posters, with multiple articles to release daily
* for owners and keepers the  websites, which need to be maintained in several languages
* for editors working with content created by third parties
* for perfection enthusiasts eager to keep their texts flawless (we are also from this bunch).
